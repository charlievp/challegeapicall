I would look at this with a chain building issue with the HAproxy unable to identify "Digicerts" root certificate.

Below solution can be attempted.


Option 1) Ensure the pem file at /etc/ssl1/certs1/combined.pem has all the certs in order of server cert, intermediate,           root CA

         a) Use the website below to verify the cert by copy pasting the pem content 
            https://www.sslshopper.com/certificate-decoder.html
         b) If it returns error, I would suggest to update the pem correctly in the order

          Combining CA certs to a pem file commands:

             1) Download the CA certs as Root.pem and intermediate.pem and copy it to the same path /etc/ssl1/certs1/ and    run below command

cat fqdnname.crt intermediate.pem root.pem fqdnname.key > Combined.pem




Option 2) If the CA certificate and all intermediate certificate are included in the combined.pem then below can be tried
        a) Add verify optional in the bind of ha proxy config
            bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/ssl1/certs1/combined.pem verify optional
            bind *:8443 ssl crt /etc/ssl1/certs1/combined.pem verify optional
        b) Resatrt the haproxy
        c) Test


Option 3) This can be tried if above two options fail 
        a) pass CA cert as different argument in the bind command like below
        b) Save the CA file CN=CAname as a CAchain.pem
        c) Save the domain certificate and key as combined.pem
        d) Add the below to the bind config of haproxy 
         bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/ssl1/certs1/combined.pem ca-file /etc/ssl1/certs1/CAchain.pem verify optional
